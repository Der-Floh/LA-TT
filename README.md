# Little Alchemist - The Tool (LA-TT)
### Manage your Cards:
With this Tool you can **manage** your Gamecards while having a great overview over them. This is accomplished by being able to Filter and Sort your cards how you want.
You can **add Cards** and **combos**, **Edit** and **Delete** them.

Adding and Editing Cards is made more easy because the Tool **searches for matches** with already existing Cards.
